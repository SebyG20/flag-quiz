## About

This is a 20-question online quiz on the flags of the world. This quiz is designed to test and improve your knowledge of countries and their flags. It is built to be simple and accessible — all you have to do is enter your username, answer the questions, and get your score, which you can learn from and retry.

## Features

- The quiz is accessible — every image includes descriptive alt text that explains what the flag looks like, so all users can understand what is shown without revealing the answer.
- The quiz is quick and easy to complete, as every question is multiple choice.
- The website uses a dark mode theme, making it easier on the eyes while allowing flag colors to stand out clearly.
- The quiz is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, so it can be used on both large and small devices.

## Lessons Learnt

At the start of this project, I wasn't very confident in using GitHub. But as the project progressed, I became more comfortable with setting up a repository, committing changes, pulling updates, and using other features GitHub offers. Now, I feel more confident using GitHub, which will make future projects much easier to manage.
